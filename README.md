Collection of Python data analysis projects using Pandas, NumPy, and CSV datasets for learning and practice.

🏋️ Gym Workout Data Analysis (Python)

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes gym workout data using Python, Pandas, and NumPy to uncover patterns related to workout types, calories burned, heart rate, workout duration, and fitness levels.
The goal is to practice real-world data analysis, including data loading, inspection, and basic insights from a CSV dataset.
This project is part of my learning journey in data analytics and Python programming.

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset (gymdata.csv) contains information about gym users and their workout habits, including:
UserID
Age
Gender
Weight (kg)
Workout Type (Cardio, Strength, Mixed)
Workout Duration (minutes)
Calories Burned
Average Heart Rate
Workout Frequency
Fitness Level

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
CSV file handling
Jupyter-style data inspection (via script output)
